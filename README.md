# Typing-Speed-Test-in-JavaScript
Typing speed test is a game where you can check your typing speed like WPM (Word Per Minute), CPM (Character Per Minute), Accuracy, etc. In my Typing Speed Test Game, the max time for typing is 60 seconds. Once you start typing, you’ll see your time, mistakes, WPM, and CPM at the bottom.

You can also erase your incorrect characters or go backward by pressing the backspace key of your keyboard. Once you have typed all characters or the time is completed, you can click on the try again button to reset the result and load a new paragraph.

I built this game using HTML CSS & Vanilla JavaScript. I hope you liked this typing speed game and understood the basic codes behind creating this game.

If you’re already familiar with JavaScript and have built projects in it then you might easily understand the codes of this game but if you are too beginner at this and didn’t build a project before then you may have difficulties to understanding the codes and concepts of this Typing Speed Test Game.
